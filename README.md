## 1. Purpose
If you find yourself spending more time selecting a movie than actually watching it. Nightwatch has a purpose to assist indecisive people with a effortless easy to use movie recomendation and storage list.

Nightwatch pulls movie database from local directories. Utilising arrays, hashes, and classes movie database is presented within the app with relation to the users request.


## 3. Intructions for use



## 4. Screenshots for use


## 5. Developer brainstorming
We faced a common issue of trying to run before we could crawl, we wanted to create a game of Battleships but eventually settled for a much simpler app. One of which could realistictly fit in our skill set and the scope. We spent 2 hours brainstorming the possible hurdles of every idea we considered, many of which did not fit within the scope but were mostly able to fit within the futures of the application. 
Below are some blueprints of different ideas we shared during the brainstorming stage:

## 7. Poject plan & timeline
From the get go we made a point of using Trello in the simplest form. We believe our scope was very achievable with room for potential addition of our other ideas under the 'Futures' list.
Nightwatch Trello has Backlog, To Do, Doing, Done, and Futures lists. These lists are self explanatory and in this case, a picture speaks a thousand words.
Below you will see images of how we used Trello throughtout the 2 days.
